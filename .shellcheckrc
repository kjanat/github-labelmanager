# ShellCheck configuration
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive

# Use bash as default shell
shell=bash

# Exclude node_modules and other generated files
# Note: ShellCheck doesn't support exclude paths in config,
# use: shellcheck $(find . -name "*.sh" -not -path "*/node_modules/*")

# Disable specific checks globally:
# SC1091: Not following sourced files (often external/dynamic)
# SC2034: Unused variables (often intentional for colors/constants)
disable=SC1091
